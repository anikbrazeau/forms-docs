# Send a message

You can use GC Notify to send emails and text messages. These might be in response to a user-generated event, like a receipt after they apply to your service, or as a reminder when a payment is due.

**What you'll need:**

To send a message with GC Notify, you'll need to set up a template in the user interface. 

To create a template:

1. [Sign in to GC Notify](https://notification.canada.ca/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page.
1. Select __New template__.

Once you've got a template ready, find the template ID associated with it. You'll need that ID to specify which template you want to use when you call the API.

Your API call must also include any fields that have been set up as personalisations. Personalisation allows you to change what shows up in a specific message as it gets sent out. You might use personalisation to:

- Address a user by their name
- Provide users with a specific link to click
- Send a unique transaction number as a follow up
- Give users a dynamically generated list of actions they need to take

## Sending an email

```
POST /v2/notifications/email
```

### Request body
```json
{
  "email_address": "sender@something.com",
  "template_id": "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a"
}
```

### Arguments

**email_address (required)**

The `email_address` of the recipient.

**template_id (required)**

To find the `template_id`:

1. [Sign in to GC Notify](https://notification.canada.ca/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant template.
1. Select __Copy template ID to clipboard__.

**personalisation (optional)**

Use `personalisation` if a template has placeholder fields for personalised information such as name or reference number, you need to provide their values in a dictionary with key value pairs. For example:

```json
"personalisation": {
  "first_name": "Amala",
  "application_date": "2018-01-01"
}
```
You can leave out this argument if a template does not have any placeholder fields for personalised information.

**reference (optional)**

`reference` is an identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or mailing address. For example:

```json
"reference": "STRING"
```
You can leave out this argument if you do not have a reference.

**email_reply_to_id (optional)** 

`email_reply_to_id` is an email address specified by you to receive replies from your users. You must add at least one reply-to email address before your service can go live.

To add a reply-to email address:

1. [Sign in to GC Notify](https://notification.canada.ca/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Settings__ page.
1. In the __Email__ section, select __Manage__ on the __Reply-to email addresses__ row.
1. Select __Add reply-to address__.
1. Enter the email address you want to use, and select __Add__.

For example:

```json
"email_reply_to_id": "8e222534-7f05-4972-86e3-17c5d9f894e2"
```

You can leave out this argument if your service only has one reply-to email address, or you want to use the default email address.

## Sending a file by email

::: warning Enabling this feature

Sending files by email is not enabled by default. To turn on this feature, [contact us](https://notification.canada.ca/contact).
:::

To send a file by email, you'll need to add a placeholder to the template then upload a file. The placeholder will contain a secure link to download the file. 

The links are unique and unguessable. GC Notify cannot access or decrypt your file.

### Add contact details to the file download page

To turn on this feature, [contact us](https://notification.canada.ca/contact).

### Add a placeholder to the template

1. [Sign in to GC Notify](https://notification.canada.ca/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant email template.
1. Select __Edit__.
1. Add a placeholder to the email template using double brackets. For example:

"Download your file at: ((link_to_file))"

### Upload your file

::: tip File types and size requirements
You can upload PDF, CSV, .jpeg, .png, .odt, .txt, .rtf,  Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word Document files. Your file must be smaller than 10MB.

[Contact us](https://notification.canada.ca/contact) if you need to send other file types.
:::

Youâ€™ll need to convert the file into a string that is base64 encoded.

Pass the encoded string into an object with a `file` key, and put that in the personalisation argument. For example:

```json
"personalisation":{
  "first_name": "Amala",
  "application_date": "2018-01-01",
  "link_to_file": {
    "file": "file as base64 encoded string"
  }
}
```

**CSV files**

Uploads for CSV files should set the `is_csv` flag as `true` to ensure it is downloaded as a .csv file. For example:

```json
"personalisation":{
  "first_name": "Amala",
  "application_date": "2018-01-01",
  "link_to_file": {
    "file": "CSV file as base64 encoded string",
    "is_csv": true
  }
}
```
