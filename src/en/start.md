## Headers

**Authorization header**

The authorization header is an [API key](keys.md). You must include an authorization header.

The header consists of:

```json
"Authorization": "ApiKey-v1 YOUR-SECRET-KEY"
```

That secret key forms a part of your [API key](keys.md), which follows the format `{key_name}-{iss-uuid}-{secret-key-uuid}`.

For example, if your API key is
`my_test_key-26785a09-ab16-4eb0-8407-a37497a57506-3d844edf-8d35-48ac-975b-e847b4f122b0`:

* your API key name is `my_test_key`
* your iss (your service ID) is `26785a09-ab16-4eb0-8407-a37497a57506`
* your secret key is `3d844edf-8d35-48ac-975b-e847b4f122b0`

Therefore, you would need to set the HTTP header to the following value:

```json
"Authorization": "ApiKey-v1 3d844edf-8d35-48ac-975b-e847b4f122b0"
```

Note that your secret key is the last 36 characters of your API key.

**Content header**

The content header is `application/json`:

```json
"Content-Type": "application/json"
```
