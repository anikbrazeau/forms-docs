# Testing

There is no test environment for GC Notify. All testing takes place in the production environment. 

## Smoke testing

If you need to smoke test your integration with GC Notify on a regular basis, you should use the following smoke test email addresses and phone numbers.

|Email address|
|:---|
|simulate-delivered@notification.canada.ca|
|simulate-delivered-2@notification.canada.ca|
|simulate-delivered-3@notification.canada.ca|

|Phone number|
|:---|
|+16132532222|
|+16132532223|
|+16132532224|

The smoke test email addresses and phone numbers will validate the request and simulate a successful response, but will not send a real message, produce a delivery receipt or persist the notification to the database.

You can use these smoke test numbers and addresses with any [type of API key](keys.md).

You can smoke test all Notify API client functions except:

- Get the status of one message
- Get the status of all messages

You cannot use the smoke test email addresses or phone numbers with these functions because they return a fake `notification_ID`. If you need to test these functions, use a test API key and any other phone number or email.

## Other testing

Use a [test API key](keys.md#test) to do non-smoke testing such as performance or integration testing. You can use any non-smoke testing email addresses or phone numbers. You do not need a specific GC Notify testing account other than your usual account.
